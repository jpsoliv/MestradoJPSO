\section{Conclusions}

The shunt active filter showed propitious for use in aircraft electrical system to enhance the power quality. The simulation results presented that the active filter response were adequate to high load variation and its operation maintain the voltage inside the limits defined by the aeronautical standards in terms of harmonic content.

There are some drawbacks when the non-linear loads, connected with their respective active filters, require low power consumption. In this case, the power quality is slightly degraded, however, not substantially to make the system operate infringing the aeronautical standards.

It should be noticed that even when the loads do not consume power, the set composed by the load and the filter do. This is caused by the energy loss in the filter operation, mainly due to the non-idealities of the switching devices, which is considerable when compared to energy is drawn by the load.
