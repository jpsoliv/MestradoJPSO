\section{Conclusions}

The simulation results showed a correct active filter response under high load variation, keeping the voltage within the limits defined by the aeronautical standards in terms of harmonic content.

There are some drawbacks when non-linear loads, connected with their respective active filters, require low power consumption. In this case, the power quality is slightly degraded, however, not substantially to make the system operate infringing the aeronautical standards.

It should be noticed that even when the loads do not consume power, the set composed by the loads and the filters draw current from the source. This is caused by the energy loss in the filter operation, mainly due to the non-idealities of the switching devices, which is considerable when compared to energy drawn by the load operating with low consumption.
