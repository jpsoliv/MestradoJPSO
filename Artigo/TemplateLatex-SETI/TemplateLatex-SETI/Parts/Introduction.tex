\section{Introduction}

The increase of the aircraft operational costs associated with the fuel consumption drives the development of new aircraft projects \citep{Babikian2002}. In this scenario, the aviation market has changed the design perception regarding the electrical system, replacing hydraulic and pneumaticâ€™s power source to electrical ones, creating the concept of the More Electrical Aircraft (MEA) \citep{Moir1999}.

This context raised the relevance of the electrical system in the role of aircraft operational safety. This way, the electrical system needs to have a greater reliability and to operate avoiding failures of the equipment connected to it. However, the rise of electrical equipment connected in the electrical system, specially the non-linear loads, has increased the harmonic distortion content introduced in the electrical grid \citep{Singer2012}, diminishing the power quality and becoming a subject of study in aircraft operational safety. 

To improve the power quality with the reduction of the total harmonic distortion (THD), some conditioners have to be applied in the equipment power input and in the electrical grid. The implementation of these conditioners must considers the reliability, weight and cost to be feasible in aircraft systems.

In this context, some topologies to increase the power quality are already use in the aircraft electrical system, such as the multi-pulse rectifiers \citep{Zhu2014,Gong2003,Lobo2005}. However, because of its weight and volume, this topology is applicable only to specific equipment, see section \ref{sec:Power_Quality}.

With the increase of the non-linear loads applied to the electrical grid, and requirements to ensure power quality, some alternatives have been proposed. The use of a shunt active filter applied in an aircraft electrical system is an item of recent study, considering different active filters topologies \citep{Chen2012research,Chen2012novel,Chen2012control}.

This article analyses the use of a shunt active filter to improve the power quality in an aircraft electrical system. It starts by reviewing the active filter operation, the instantaneous power theory, and continues discussing control techniques. A simulation is presented to analyze the shunt active filter operation with three electrohydraulic actuators (EHA), which are non-linear loads used to control the aircraft latero-directional and longitudinal aerodynamics surfaces. The simulation model is compounded by the electrical generation and distribution system connected to the EHAs with its respective active filter in parallel.
