\section{Conclusions}

The simulation results showed a correct active filter response under high load variation, keeping the voltage within the limits defined by the aeronautical standards in terms of harmonic content.

There are some drawbacks with non-linear loads connected with their respective active filters. In the case of low power consumption, the power quality is slightly degraded. However, the deterioration does not drive the system operation out of the aeronautical standards.

It should be noticed that even without load power consumption, the set composed by loads and filters draw current from the source. This is caused by the energy loss in the filter operation, mainly due to the non-idealities of the switching devices. This loss is not negligible in comparison with the energy drawn by the load operating in low consumption mode.
